import csv

"""
This program reads the data of annual child deaths of several countries and regions of the world.
Data was obtained from data bank of the Banco Mundial published in the web:

- Data comes in a csv file (datos_muertes_infantiles.csv)
- Data could be read also using the Pandas library or NumPy, but I want to show step by step how it could be done
  through the basic tools provided by Python

separator = "," # this is the character that separates the fields

#for i in range(61):

        #Each entry of the datos_dict dictionary contains its key (countryCode) and 62 values stored in a list, as follows:
        #- countryName (string)
        #- 61 int values corresponding to the figures for 61 years (1960 to 2020) of deaths information

        # Add one entry to the datos_dict dictionary:
        datos_dict[countryCode] = [countryName] # add the Country Name to the list of values
        for i in range(4, 65):
            #datos_dict[countryCode].append(int(cols[i])) # add each one of the annual values
            datos_dict[countryCode].append(row[i]) # add each one of the 61 annual values to the list that stores the data of this country
            #print(cols[i])

"""
Data was stored normally in the datos_dict dictionary.
Now, we can analyze the data, processing the individual values of each key of the dictionary, for example,
we will find the mean, the standard deviation, the mÃ¡ximum and the minimum for all the data (number of deaths)
